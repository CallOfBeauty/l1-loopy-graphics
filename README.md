## Use C-Turtle to create something that makes you happy!
-  Creativity is encouraged and will be rewarded.
-  A-level work will demonstrate excellent effort!
-  Be sure you use looping and one or more conditinals!

### Starter files have been provided for you in C++

1. **REASON FOR ART CHOICE**
*Why did this particular art appeal to you and make you happy?*

I chose helicopter because my favorite balkan song is named helicopter helicopter

2. **TITLE** 
*Name your work of art and explain why you chose this name.*

Helicopter


3. **C-Turtle METHODS** 
*How much difficulty did you have figuring out how to use the C-Turtle library? Did your knowledge of the Python Turtle library help?*

It took me some time to get adjusted with the new punctuation, but my previous knowledge was very helpful because the vocabulary is pretty much the same

4. **C-Turtle USABILITY**
*Was there anything that you tried that did not work? Explain.*

Yes. I tried using the mouse touching function, but for some reason I would get runtime errors in a line of code, inside the turtle library



5. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process, 
including how much your initial design plan evolved, 
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent 
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. 
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

My plan initially was to ask how many helicopters the user would like to, so they could go for a ride with their friends. I couldn't do that, because I had some issues with defining a function for the helicopters.'My implementation process was to first ask the question and get the data I needed from the user and then create the helicopter.I achieved the helicopter, by drawing it physically on a board, and then doing the instrinctions one by one, the way I thought of them when drawing the helicopter
The whole process took about 2 hours, along with 30 or so minutes because I was trying to get familiar with debuging after some errors I experienced.

6. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered 
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the 
lab easier for you.*

 I had some issues with defining whole functions that would create a helicopter. This is because I could not have the fucntion outside of the main function, because I would need a way to import the turtle into that function and I don't know how to do that in the C turtle library.
 I think that an intro or a guide to this library could have helped see better what methods of the turtle library work and dont work. This could just be online documentation from a website or comments on the library.

7. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors 
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

I cannot understand why the color of the main circle of the helicopter does not work. I have tried several things and it keeps being blue no matter if the if statement exists or not. 

8. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments 
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

I learned that punctuation is really important in C++. Especially the ; which can mess up the whole program and is very hard to spot. I also learned that C++ is not forgiving at all and will produce a major error, even with a simple syntax error.
It is also really important to plan in C, plan the variables that you are going to use and the inputs you need.


9. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and 
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.*

I did not receice any help from TA's or any websites. I also did not help anyone do their lab
